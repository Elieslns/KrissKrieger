Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
The client-side is built with **React 18** using TypeScript and leverages modern UI libraries:
- **Vite** as the build tool and development server for fast development and optimized production builds
- **shadcn/ui** component library built on Radix UI primitives for accessible, customizable components
- **Tailwind CSS** for utility-first styling with custom CSS variables for theming
- **React Hook Form** with Zod validation for type-safe form handling
- **TanStack Query** for server state management and caching
- **Wouter** as a lightweight client-side router
- Single-page application (SPA) with smooth scrolling navigation between sections

### Backend Architecture
The server-side uses **Express.js** with TypeScript:
- RESTful API design with `/api` prefix for all endpoints
- Rate limiting implemented for contact form submissions (5 requests per 15-minute window per IP)
- Input validation using Zod schemas shared between client and server
- Error handling middleware with proper HTTP status codes
- Session-based architecture ready (connect-pg-simple for PostgreSQL sessions)

### Data Storage Solutions
- **PostgreSQL** database using Neon serverless infrastructure
- **Drizzle ORM** for type-safe database operations and migrations
- Schema definitions shared between client and server via `shared/schema.ts`
- In-memory storage fallback (`MemStorage`) for development/testing environments
- Database migrations managed through `drizzle-kit`

### Authentication and Authorization
The application includes infrastructure for user authentication:
- User schema with username/password fields
- Session management setup with PostgreSQL store
- Authentication endpoints prepared but not currently utilized in the main application flow
- Secure password handling patterns implemented

### Email Integration
- **SendGrid** integration for transactional emails
- HTML email templates with proper escaping for security
- Graceful degradation when email service is unavailable
- Contact form submissions saved to database regardless of email delivery status
